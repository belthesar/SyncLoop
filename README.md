# SyncLoop
Frame perfect audio+animation sync. Like YTMND but better.  

Uses the Web Audio API and HTML5 canvas to sync animations to songs. See examples for config.

Some examples:  
[Certified Working Material](http://loop.mon.im/working.html)  
[Am I Poplar Yet?](http://loop.mon.im/)  
[Life In a Nutshell](http://loop.mon.im/LifeInANutshell.html)  

All examples are converted from wonderful flash loops by Pyure and AMM.
